# Autogen_experiments
Autogen is a framework to build multi-conversational agents, This repo contains some of the code I have experimented with. This code might have some bugs. But the idea is to explore the framework rather than writing sophisticated code. For more examples explore the official Autogen repo.

Also note that OAI_CONFIG_LIST file is has to be created by referring to the sample in the repo
