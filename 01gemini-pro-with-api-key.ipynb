       "> * **Plate tectonics:** Plate tectonics has played a role in creating diverse habitats and nutrient cycling, both of which are important for life.\n",

    "Embedding is a technique used to represent information as a list of floating point numbers in an array. With Gemini, you can represent text (words, sentences, and blocks of text) in a vectorized form, making it easier to compare and contrast embeddings. For example, two texts that share a similar subject matter or sentiment should have similar embeddings, which can be identified through mathematical comparison techniques such as cosine similarity.
